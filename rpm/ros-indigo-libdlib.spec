%description
This package wraps the external c++ library dlib (http://dlib.net/) in a ROS
package, so other packages can use it. It downloads the source code of it and
then builds it, corresponding to the web page of it, using cmake. The build
library is a static library and will be copied to the created common/lib folder.
The necessary header files will be copied to the common/include folder. The
include folder needs to exist before building the package, because in the
CMakeLists you have to specify where the headers are and if the folder doesn't
exist, catkin won't be able to build the package. For further descriptions and
tutorials see the Makefile.tarball and http://dlib.net/ .
